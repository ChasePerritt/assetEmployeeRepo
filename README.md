# assetEmployeeRepo

This is the asset and employee manager program for Classwork 6 in CSCI 352

# Files Required:

AssetManager contains all of the required files, the most important of which are the .xaml, .xaml.cs, and Data Set files.

The .xaml and .xaml.cs files determine the appearance of the GUI; meanwhile, the Data Set files contain information to be displayed (assets and employees).

# Notes:

There are two sets of data in the GitHub repo. They should be mostly identical; however, the assets on one were changed after I realized it would make more sense for the assets to be related. The program does not take any input for which data set to use, so this should be fine.
